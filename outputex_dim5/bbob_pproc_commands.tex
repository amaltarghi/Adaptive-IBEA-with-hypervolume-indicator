                and, in braces as dispersion measure, the half difference between 10 and 
                90\%-tile of (bootstrapped) runtimes is shown for the different
                target \Df-values as shown in the top row. 
                \#succ is the number of trials that reached the last target

                The median number of conducted function evaluations is additionally given in

        \aRT\ loss ratio versus the budget in number of $f$-evaluations
        divided by dimension.
        For each given budget \FEvals, the target value \ftarget\ is computed
        as the best target $f$-value reached within the
        budget by the given algorithm.
        Shown is then the \aRT\ to reach \ftarget\ for the given algorithm
        or the budget, if the GECCO-BBOB-2009 best algorithm
        reached a better target within the budget,
        divided by the best \aRT\
        seen in GECCO-BBOB-2009 to reach \ftarget.
        Line: geometric mean. Box-Whisker error bar: 25-75\%-ile with median
        (box), 10-90\%-ile (caps), and minimum and maximum \aRT\ loss ratio

        in a single trial in this function subset. See also
